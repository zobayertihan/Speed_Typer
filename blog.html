            <h2>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage.</h2>
            <p>
                Local Storage is a web storage technique that enables us to store data as key/value pairs in a web
                browser on the client's computer. Unless the user manually deletes the data from the browser, it remains
                in local storage for all time. Even if the user closes the tab or window, it still remains valid.
                Instead, up until and unless the browser's memory is erased, the data is kept in the browser.
                <br>
                <br>
                The read-only sessionStorage property provides access to Session Storage objects. Local storage data
                never expires, in contrast to session storage data that is deleted after a page session ends, which is
                the difference between the two types of storage.

            <h2>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope.</h2>
            <p>
                Global variables are declared outside of any function or curly braces and have a global scope. Global
                scope denotes that a variable may be accessed from anywhere in the program, including any function or
                conditional state.
                <br>
                <br>
                The scope of the variables enclosed in curly brackets is known as the block scope. These curly brackets
                may now be used for conditional statements, loops, or other things. These variables may only be referred
                to from inside the curly brackets.
